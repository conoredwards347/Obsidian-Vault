## $1^{st}$ Zeno's Paradox: Achilles Paradox

>[!faq] What is the Achilles Paradox?
> The **Achilles paradox** is designed to prove that the slower mover will never be passed by the swifter in a race. The dichotomy paradox is designed to prove that an object never reaches the end. Any moving object must reach halfway on a course before it reaches the end; and because there are an infinite number of halfway points, a moving object never reaches the end in a finite time.
