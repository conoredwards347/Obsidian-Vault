**Definition**: Convex optimisation is a subfield of mathematical optimisation that studies the problem of minimising convex functions over convex sets (or, equivalently, maximising concave functions over convex sets). Many classes of convex optimisation problems admit polynomial-time algorithms, whereas mathematical optimisation is in general NP-hard.

A convex optimisation problem is in _standard form_ if it is written as:
